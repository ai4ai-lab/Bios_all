I have graduated from Imperial College London in 2024 with a strong foundation in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, complemented by management expertise. My current research focuses on the application of reinforcement learning in the healthcare industry, specifically in quantifying uncertainty to improve decision-making processes. I have a deep interest in the intersection of human and AI decision-making, exploring the critical question of when and how we can trust these systems. My goal is to contribute to advancements in AI that enhance the reliability and effectiveness of technology in high-stakes environments like healthcare.
