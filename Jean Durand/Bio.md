I am an MSc Computing (Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence) student at Imperial College London. I graduated with a degree in Statistics and Computer Science from Stellenbosch University. My research interest is in Causality and Probabilistic Models. My current project specifically focusses on Causal Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Causal Graphs. In the project we specifically look at Causal Discovery and Bayesian Optimization.
